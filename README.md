Topotime (v0.2 tt-geojson)
==========================

Topo (from Greek τοπο-, combining form of τόπος place)

Topotime is a data model, JSON data format, D3 timeline layout, and software functions for representing and computing over complex spatial-temporal phenomena, particularly for historical applications where extents are uncertain. Whereas Topotime v0.1 was focused on time, Topotime v0.2 models the spatial and temporal attributes of geographic features co-equally, and adopts the basic forms of GeoJSON and GeoJSON-LD. It is under active development, and forks, comments, suggestions, and reasonably polite brickbats are welcome.
