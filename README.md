Topotime (v0.2 tt-geojson)
==========================

[__DRAFT__]

Topotime is a data model, pragmatic JSON data format, D3 timeline layout, and functions for representing and computing over complex spatial-temporal phenomena, particularly for historical applications. Whereas Topotime v0.1 was focused on time, Topotime v0.2 models the spatial and temporal attributes of geographic features co-equally, and adopts the basic form of GeoJSON and GeoJSON-LD. It is under active development, and forks, comments, suggestions, and reasonably polite brickbats are welcome.
