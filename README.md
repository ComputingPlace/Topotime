Topotime v0.2 (tt-geojson)
==========================

__topo__ (_from Greek τοπο-, a combining form of **τόπος** place_)

Topotime is a data model, JSON data format, D3 timeline layout, and software functions for representing and computing over complex spatial-temporal phenomena (places, periods, and events), particularly for historical applications where extents are uncertain. Whereas Topotime v0.1 was focused on time, Topotime v0.2 models the spatial and temporal attributes of geographic features co-equally, and adopts some basic forms of GeoJSON and GeoJSON-LD. It is under active development, and forks, comments, suggestions, and reasonably polite brickbats are welcome.
