 
Topotime currently permits the computation of:

* Intersections (overlap) between between a query timespan and a collection of Periods, answering questions like "what periods overlapped with the timespan \[-433, -344\] (Plato's lifespan possibilities)?" with an ordered list.

#####Files (JavaScript):

* js/timeline.js - A D3 timeline layout
* js/topo\_projection.js - Temporal projection function used for topotime data
* js/example.js - Example code for using the timeline layout and displaying the processed results
* index.html - Renders a D3 timeline to a web page
* us_states.html - Interactive timeline joined with a map
* stacked_timelines.html - 
* data_from_csv.html - Demonstrates parsing of topotime data written in CSV

#####Files (Python)
* py/periodic-0.1.py - Parses a topotime data file and generates temporal geometries in 3 formats (\*.pickle used by ajax-0.1.py for calculating intersections; \*\_geom_d3.json for rendering in D3).
* py/ajax-0.1.py - Functions for computing % intersect between Period timespans
* demo_py.html - Some interactive access to Python functions and basic visualizations of temporal geometry

#####Example Data

These files can be parsed by both timeline.js (for rendering timelines) and periodic.py (for other calculations)
* data/topotime_format.json - Supported period/timespan types
* data/pleiades98.json - 98 of 100 historic periods from the Pleiades project
* data/us_history.json - The "lifespans" of the 50 US states, plus some other events
* data/axial.json - Lifespans of (somewhat) contemporaneous historical figures in an "Axial Age"
* data/ww2.json - A TomHanks-ish scenario of 8 events during WW2, demonstrates 'sls' and 'eee' elements.
* data/dance.json - The lifespan of George Dance the Younger (1741-1825), an architect
* data/pleiades\_periods.json - pleiades\_periods.csv converted into a JSON object with the addition of an extra period("Holocene Climatic Optimum") with no defined timespan
* data/pyout/*.json, *.pickle - generated by py/periodic.py


#####Future developments
* Alternative JSON-LD (linked data) representation of the data model
* Further examples tied to geospatial and network data
* Smoothed curves for 'sls' and 'eee' fuzzy bounds
* Further example queries to temporal geometries
* Examples that allow for interactive updating of data
* Serious engagement with the concept of temporal projection, defining projections for reign periods, Islamic calendar, BP, etc.
