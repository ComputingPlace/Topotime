courier data issues

- CHGIS_IDs in geodata don't correspond to TGAZ record
- route segments between SYS_IDs 745 and 84 have no intermediary nodes/places; 742, 744, 745 & 746 are missing nodes
- this data seems to be a route system; we don't know particular course taken

the edge ends offset from these nodes are beyond tolerance (corrected in my copy)
623, 775, 627, 715, 742, 745, 638, 744, 709, 637, 379, 746, 579,
